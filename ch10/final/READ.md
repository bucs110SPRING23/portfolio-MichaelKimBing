## Title: Free Bitcoin Banking System

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
## The program is a virtual mini banking system, only specific to the Bitcoin crytpocurrency, that offers the user one bitcoin for free in order to see the exchange rate of how much the bitcoin is worth in other countries.  The user will be asked if they would see the current value of Bitcoin, which will then give the user options of what they would like to do with the bitcoin that is obtained and to see if they wish to know more about its value.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
## There might be an instance where the user may want to put the decimals after the third question is asked, but it was asked by the system to put in whole numbers.  Also the exchange rates and the values may show up as having more decimal places as that is how the two AI's were built to record the values of the bitcoin and the exchange.

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
## To check a dictionary within another dictionary - Nested Dictionaries - https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/nested-dictionary

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
##  When the program asks for the amount you wish to exchange, there might be a mean message in the end if you input a value less than or equal to 0.  Apologies for this custom message.
