## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
## The turtle is designing the simplistic overview of a scene from Star Wars: the New Hope, where the Death Star destroying a random home planet, which is civilized to 550000000 aliens.  The program will begin to request the user to input in the intensity of the explosion from the laser by giving it an integer value, where 0 is the lowest intensity, then the program will draws 25 random stars, where code will then draw the random planet and then the Death Star shooting the laser until impact, then it will reveal how much did the user incinerate with the death star.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
## There are might be some instances where the turtle will draw outside of the user's window, since the drawing was completed under a window that was 2560 x 1440 pixels.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
