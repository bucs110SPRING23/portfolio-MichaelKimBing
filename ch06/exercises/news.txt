With a total of 589 trillion tokens in circulation and a price of 0.00001, Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently has an overall market capitalization of $6 billion. If the token were to surge to the value of $1/token, as previously speculated, this would suggest an incredible implied valuation of $589 trillion – greatly exceeding even global gross domestic product.

Shiba Inu (SHIB), continues to make headlines with its latest developments. Shiba Inu has seen a surge in popularity, with many investors drawn to its potential for high returns. As the demand for Shiba Inu (SHIB) grows, its community of holders and traders continues to expand.

Of course, any serious investor will realize that such a price would not be attainable without drastic reductions in supply. Nevertheless, many crypto enthusiasts are enticed by the potential profits of investing in this unique millennial-driven cryptocurrency, given its current low price and high potential rewards.

So no, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is extremely unlikely ever to reach $1 unless we see a burning mechanism built into the fundamentals of the project. However, it’s not all bad news. From here, it is very possible to see a 10X or even more if we see a strong bull market play out over the next few years..
